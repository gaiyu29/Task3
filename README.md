After analyzing the Amazon sales report, a few key patterns emerged. T-shirts, shirts, and blazers are the top-performing product categories, generating the highest revenue. T-shirts alone contributed nearly â‚¹4 crore, making them the best-selling item by far. Most of these sales came from states like Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu, showing strong demand from major urban centers.

In terms of fulfillment, the majority of orders (around 69%) were handled by Amazon's own logistics, while the rest were shipped by merchants. However, a noticeable 14% of all orders ended up being canceled, which is quite significant and might require further review to understand if it's due to stock issues, delays, or customer dissatisfaction.

Interestingly, only a small fraction (less than 1%) of the orders were B2B, indicating that almost all sales are to individual customers. This might be a missed opportunity for growth in the wholesale or corporate segments.

Looking at the monthly trend, revenue slightly declined from August to December 2022. This could be due to seasonal fluctuations or possibly a post-festival dip in orders.
